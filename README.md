# US-Political-Framing-Analysis
This pipeline was created as a project for my LING 413 class.  I wrote a paper, "Analyzing Political Framing and Polarization in U.S. Senator Tweets Using Word Embeddings" based on its findings.

## Abstract:
This paper explores the framing of political ideas and issues in U.S. politics by the Democratic and Republican parties through the analysis of partisan word embeddings trained on a dataset of 99,693 tweets.  It finds that there is substantial framing differences in relevant ideas and issues between parties, with an average jaccard similarity score of 0.0367 and an average cosine similarity score of 0.1589 for chosen words.  It explores the quantitative similarities for each keyword, and qualitatively evaluates the different nearest neighbors of the keywords to form a greater picture of each parties' lexicon.  Keywords \textit{abortion}, \textit{capitalism}, \textit{climate change}, \textit{environment}, \textit{gun}, \textit{immigrant}, \textit{immigration}, \textit{inflation}, \textit{justice}, \textit{medicare}, \textit{police}, \textit{racism}, \textit{security}, \textit{tax}, \textit{terrorism}, and \textit{voting right} show stark partisan divergence (jaccard and cosine similarity scores of 0), while keywords \textit{education, economy, equality, freedom, military, patriotism, right, truth}, and \textit{veteran} reported the highest similarity between parties.
