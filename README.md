# US-Political-Framing-Analysis

This pipeline was created as a project for my LING 413 class. I wrote a research paper, [*Analyzing Political Framing and Polarization in U.S. Senator Tweets Using Word Embeddings*](https://github.com/ellahap/US-Political-Framing-Analysis/blob/main/research-paper.pdf) based on my work.

## Abstract

This paper explores the framing of political ideas and issues in U.S. politics by the Democratic and Republican parties through the analysis of partisan word embeddings trained on a dataset of 99,693 tweets. It finds that there are substantial framing differences in relevant ideas and issues between parties, with an average Jaccard similarity score of **0.0367** and an average cosine similarity score of **0.1589** for chosen words.

It explores the quantitative similarities for each keyword and qualitatively evaluates the different nearest neighbors of the keywords to form a greater picture of each party's lexicon.

Keywords *abortion*, *capitalism*, *climate change*, *environment*, *gun*, *immigrant*, *immigration*, *inflation*, *justice*, *medicare*, *police*, *racism*, *security*, *tax*, *terrorism*, and *voting right* show stark partisan divergence (Jaccard and cosine similarity scores of 0), while keywords *education*, *economy*, *equality*, *freedom*, *military*, *patriotism*, *right*, *truth*, and *veteran* reported the highest similarity between parties.
